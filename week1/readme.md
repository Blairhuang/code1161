TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In the first lecture, the tutor basically introduce the general structure as well as the course outline in the first semester. By engaging into the softwares like Visual Studio Code and python, those useful techniques are benefitial for our future's careers. Apart from that, we can create the special programme by ourself and brainstorm some perfect ideas. In the tutorial class, we had downloaded necessary applications and finish exercise one in programming the first code "hello world!".
Through this task, we laernt about function which contains debug. Except for studing fundamental procedures, we laern how to connect the VS code with Github which will autometically deliver to the repository and tutor will check our work conviniently.
